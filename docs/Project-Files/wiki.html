    <b>Some things to consider while scheduling:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The entries are done through MSSQL and can be a bit slow when you open it up after a while. This is normal and is for optimization.</li>
        <li>Use the Text Editor tab to format the text easily along with seeing how many characters will be used. This is great for Twitter posts.</li>
        <li>Twitter links cannot exceed 23 characters and each character takes away from the total 280 character limit. So use short links or images instead.</li>
        <li>You cannot post an image and a url in the same post. The url is used when you want to display the image from the website's open graph image, if they have one. If you want a link and an image in the post then put the link in the message instead.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that your computer must be running and the Social Post Scheduler must be running for posts to be posted so if you reboot your computer when a post is scheduled then it will be skipped.</li>
        <li>To post a video, post it manually to your facebook page once and then grab the post link and then use that link in the link field to post them as a scheduled post.</li>
        <li>Posting too many posts at the same time could cause issues on slower networks. Spread them out over a few minutes if this happens.</li>
        <li>Make sure to setup backup and cleanup during a time that you won't be posting or editing the schedule.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Step 1:</b>
    <p>Generate USER Token with proper permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>public_profile</li>
        <li>pages_show_list</li>
        <li>pages_read_engagement</li>
        <li>pages_read_user_content</li>
        <li>pages_manage_posts</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <br>
    <b>Step 2:</b>
    <p>Generate Page Token; similar steps as above.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Step 3:</b>
    <p>Generate Long Lived Token by clicking on the info for the access token and Open in Access Token Tool. At the bottom is Extend Token.</p>
    <p>Use that new token for the url below and in that new page will be the permanent token. Account ID is the user's id highlighted above.</p>
    <p>Permanent Token: <a href="https://graph.facebook.com/{your-user-id}/accounts?access_token={user-access-token}" target="_blank">https://graph.facebook.com/{your-user-id}/accounts?access_token={user-access-token}</a></p>
    <i>NOTE: You have to repeat step 2 and up for each page.</i>
